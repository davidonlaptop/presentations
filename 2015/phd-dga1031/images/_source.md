- [intro-acgt.jpg](http://unlockinglifescode.org/sites/default/files/acgt_lg.jpg): ACGT is an acronym for the four types of bases found in a DNA molecule: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). http://unlockinglifescode.org/media/images/481#482
- [intro-allele.jpg](http://unlockinglifescode.org/sites/default/files/allele_lg.jpg): An allele is one of two or more versions of a gene. An individual inherits two alleles for each gene, one from each parent. http://unlockinglifescode.org/media/images/458?page=1#459
- [intro-cancer.jpg](http://unlockinglifescode.org/sites/default/files/cancer_lg.jpg): Cancer is a group of diseases characterized by uncontrolled cell growth. Cancer begins when a single cell mutates, resulting in a breakdown of the normal regulatory controls that keep cell division in check. http://unlockinglifescode.org/media/images/409#410
- [intro-gene.jpg](http://unlockinglifescode.org/sites/default/files/exon.jpg): An exon is the portion of a gene that codes for amino acids. In the cells of plants and animals, most gene sequences are broken up by one or more DNA sequences called introns. http://unlockinglifescode.org/media/images/444#446
- [ntro-genome.jpg](http://unlockinglifescode.org/sites/default/files/genome_lg.jpg): The genome is the entire set of genetic instructions found in a cell. In humans, the genome consists of 23 pairs of chromosomes, found in the nucleus, as well as a small chromosome found in the cells' mitochondria. http://unlockinglifescode.org/media/images/458#468
- [intro-mutation.jpg](http://unlockinglifescode.org/sites/default/files/mutation_lg.jpg): A mutation is a change in a DNA sequence. Mutations can result from DNA copying mistakes made during cell division, exposure to ionizing radiation, exposure to chemicals called mutagens, or infection by viruses. http://unlockinglifescode.org/media/images/458?page=1#474
- [intro-zygocy.jpg](http://unlockinglifescode.org/sites/default/files/heterozygous_lg.jpg): Heterozygous refers to having inherited different forms of a particular gene from each parent. http://unlockinglifescode.org/media/images/458#469
