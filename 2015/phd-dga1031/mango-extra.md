## Mango: Massive data mining ANalysis of Genetic Observations

## Methodology - Analysis Techniques

- Measuring before (plink 1.07 and plink 1.9) and after (MANGO):
  - **Scalability**
    - Platform = Amazon AWS (cloud computing)
    - Dataset = 5 open source genomes from the 1000 Genomes Project
    - Nb of runs = 5 runs on each dataset.
    - Nb of records = TODO T.B.D. (+ annotations ?)
    - Tool = to record duration? TODO T.B.D.
    - Job Turnaround time (ISO 25010) or _wall clock time_ ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall-clock_time)): duration as perceived by the user
    - Total CPU execution time (ISO 25010): cumulative duration of all nodes
    - Speedup (Amdahl's law), (Karp-Flatt metric), (Gustafson's law)
      - For distributed system, the effective speedup is (CITATION NEEDED)
        - `S(N) = T(N) / T(1)` where `T`: Turnaround Time, and `N`: NB of worker nodes
  
  - **Functional correctness (_accuracy_)** (ISO 25010)
    - We'll compare plink 1.9 and MANGO's results against results from plink 1.07
    - NOTE: the assesment method will be precised once the genomic analysis to be optimized has been selected
    - TODO: How do we validate the accuracy? With a genetician?
    - Quality characteristics to evaluate (QUINT-2):
      - **Failure ratio**: *the ratio of incorrect processed transactions to the total of presented transactions*
      - **Significant digit ratio**: *the ratio of the implemented significant digits to the required significant digits.*
 
  - **Usability**
    - **Compatibility** (ISO 25010) with file formats (VCF, ADAM, etc.)
    - **Interoperability** (ISO 25010) of MANGO with plink
    - **Expert judgement on operability** (ISO 25010) Is MANGO's command line easy to use, as judged by experts in the field (bioinformaticians). We'll send a satisfaction survey to the bioinformaticians involved in the 2 case studies.

## Appendix A: Relevant quality attributes from Quint-2 (temporary notes)

  - 1. Functionality
    - 1.2 **Accuracy** (renamed to "functional correctness" in ISO 25010)
      - Are the MANGO results as accurate as with the original plink?
      - (the evaluation will depends on the selected genomic analysis)
      - 1.2.1 **Failure ratio**: *the ratio of incorrect processed transactions to the total of presented transactions*
      - 1.2.2 **Significant digit ratio**: *the ratio of the implemented significant digits to the required significant digits.*
    - 1.3 **Interoperability** with VCF, ADAM and other plink formats => moved to compatibility
      - 1.3.2 **Matched data format ratio**: *the ratio of data formats matched to those of the other system in the interoperation*
      - 1.3.4 **Matched interface ratio**: *the ratio of interfaces matched to those of the other systems in interoperation*
    - 1.6 **Traceability**
      - *Ease of verifying correctness of data processing on required points*
  - 3. **Usability**
    - 3.2 **Learnability**: *Availability of help functions* integrated on the command line client (plink does not have inline help for all features)
    - 3.3 **Operability**: *Users' effort for operation and operation control*
      - 3.3.1 **Expert judgement on operability**: *The extent to which the software products presents functionality to the user without hindrance, as judget by a team of experts in this field.*
    - 3.4 **Explicitness**: *Clarity of the software product's status (progression bars, etc.).*
  - 4. **Performance Efficiency**:
    - 4.1 **Time behavior**
      - 4.1.4 **Processing capacity**: *Number of processing tasks of a certain type that the user can perform during a certain period with a certain usage load.* (e.g. executing the same analysis with varying parameters in parallel)
      - 4.1.7 **Turnaround time**: *Indicates the speed of processing by measuring the elapsed time between the beginning of process requirement and gaining the result of the process.*.
      - 4.1.10 **CPU execution time**
    - 4.2 **Resource behavior**: need to record RAM,CPU,DISK,NETWORK usage over time as a secondary comparison measure

## TODO (temporary notes)
Survey 1:
- identify the minimal set of features for the adoption of a novel analytic software. There will be import/export feature to/from plink and VCF. But since the scope of plink is too large, users will still need to use 2 software for some time. So what is the minimal set of feature required so that users are willing to use 2 software instead of 1 (even if slower).
